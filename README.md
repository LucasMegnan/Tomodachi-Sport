# Tomodachi-Sport

# Overview

Initially, the app's concept would be called **Tomodachi Sport**. The idea comes from Tamagotchis, the virtual pets created by the Japanese company Bandai in 1996, and the fact that Tomodachi means "friend" in Japanese.

The goal is to create a mini-version of yourself or a fictional character that **develops by doing physical activities** in real life. 
Once your character is created, you can add friends in the app using a **friend code**. Over time, you can view your character’s
**progress history** and compare it with your friends or on national and international leaderboards to make exercising more competitive and challenging, with a **reward system** that recognizes users’ achievements.

# Action Plan

## Specific short term goal

- setup Flutter & wakatime, reorganize the readme and functional.
- coding with flutter to make little things and maybe connect in bluetooth and keep track of it on the little app.
- start the figma and the technical.
- If necessary update the functional.
- use project and GitHub Issue (-> use it like a reminder) to keep track of the work.

## Concrete actions to take starting tomorrow

- setup the repository.
- research about wakatime and flutter to setup it in my computer.
- coding 1 hour per day.
- research about transfer information from a smartwatch to an app.
- coding to add bluetooth connection.

## How I will measure my progress

- Meeting with another student to keep track of our work every Sundays.

## Possible obstacles and anticipated solutions

- Stay at the school after lessons with someone to work on the moonshot, to avoid procrastination.
